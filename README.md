### Hello and welcome!ðŸ¤—

I created this repository on my summer holidayðŸŒ‡, which means I started learning frontend technologies this summer. I began with HTML and CSS, and to practice, I started making webpages and websites. It was very interesting and this way I created more than 20 webpages and websites. In this repository, you can find examples of my work and see my progress as I continue to improve my skills. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy my projects!ðŸ—‚

#### Take a look at the screenshots below to see some of my projectsðŸ–¼
